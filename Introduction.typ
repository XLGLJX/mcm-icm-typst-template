Bathing in a tub is a perfect choice for those who have been worn out after a long day's working. A traditional bathtub is a simply water containment vessel without a secondary heating system or circulating jets. Thus the temperature of water in bathtub declines noticeably as time goes by, which will influent the experience of bathing. As a result, the bathing person needs to add a constant trickle of hot water from a faucet to reheat the bathing water. This way of bathing will result in waste of water because when the capacity of the bathtub is reached, excess water overflows the tub.

An optimal bathing strategy is required for the person in a bathtub to get comfortable bathing experience while reducing the waste of water.
